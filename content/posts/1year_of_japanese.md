Today marks day 365 of studying Japanese.
More specifically today marks my one-year streak on Anki.
I started very excited about my Japanese journey.
After 300+ days of Anki, I hate to admit it but at the moment I feel jaded.

I feel like I wasted one year of my life just wasting it on "learning" this language.
In the beginning, I was learning around 8 new words per day and 15 kanji daily, I was feeling strong
I was so excited about learning all these new words and managed to pick up some words here and there while
watching anime.
After roughly five to six months (I do not remember the exact moment) I felt like Anki was more of a chore\
rather than an "opportunity," I felt like I had to do Anki or I would lose my streak.

And so I did.
I stopped learning new words, I just started reviewing my old cards.
In the beginning, I thought: "Oh this is like a tiny burnout, no biggie tomorrow I will start again with  new cards."
Something happened in my brain, for the love of me I could not keep any new words inside my brain, they would
just not register.
I tried re-learning five words per day. After a week Anki was getting too overwhelming again.
I stopped learning new words for a while but this time I only started adding three words per day.
Same result again, I would be nice for a couple of days and then it would get overwhelming again.

My plan when starting was:
- Do Japanese from Zero 1 through 5,
- Do the core 2K deck
- Learn around 1000 kanji

Only then I could start immersing in Japanese.


*I didn't manage to achieve a single goal.*
The grammar book I was studying (JFZ!), I managed to reach the 
halfway point of book 3.

In the core 2k deck I only managed to learn 1161 new words (btw to reach 2000 new words it means that you have to learn 5.5 new words per day).

The only goal that I could say I almost achieved is the Kanji.
I can read and write (using the correct stroke order) 987 unique Kanji, again still falling short of that 1000 but for this one, I do not feel
so bad lol.

After all this time sometimes I wonder if is it even worth doing this.
It just feels like a nonstop grind where I will never see the benefit.
After some thinking, I arrived at my decision.

*I believe Japanese is_ still worth all the pain*
But this time I want to try things differently.
I want to ditch all these self-imposed targets that I have to reach before immersing, I am going to start immersing now regardless of how ready I am.

One thing that I learned in programming is that unless I start with a personal project that I will have to suffer for many weeks I can never learn that 
programming language.

Yes, someone could take the approach of first watching a tutorial or two before starting out but sometimes this tutorial might become never-ending 
and you will never be make a project by yourself, forever stuck in tutorial hell.

What I mean is, *unless you are willing to take the plunge* on something, you will forever be stuck in this loop of self-doubt and just overall 
unhappiness with what you are doing.

I understand that It might seem intimidating at first but unfortunately, there is no other way around it.
To do what I am preaching I will start this  [30-day Japanese challenge](https://learnjapanese.moe/routine/) by the Moe Way.
I understand that this challenge is targeted at complete beginners but it also really focuses on immersion, and on that part, I am a complete novice.

This challenge forces you to listen to native material and try to immerse yourself in the language.
In conjunction with the challenge, I will also start mining words inside my immersion and stop using a pre-made deck.
Hopefully, this will re-ignite my passion for the Japanese language and I will be able to get out of this seemingly never-ending slump.
